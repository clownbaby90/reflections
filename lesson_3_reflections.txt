1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

 Whenever you are changing in between machines or worry about the reliability of your machine.

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 
 
 A change may be made to the remote repository that would break the code you are currently
working on.
