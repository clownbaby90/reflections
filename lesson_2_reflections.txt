1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you intialize a repository it prepares it for being submitted github.
The .git folder is typically hidden, but contains the meta data that is used
for retrieving previous commits.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?
 
 The staging area acts as an intermediary between the working directory and the
 repository. It helps the user from making commits that don't logically make sense.
